Instructions:

-Import the project in Android Studio and tweak the parameters as desired, such as IP address,
 in ObjectTrackerActivity.java.
-An apk has been (in folder apk/) provided pointing to the IP address "192.168.0.100". You can use that one if appropriate.

Note: This was developed on a Google Pixel so ideally use the same phone.
